Various bits of mad computer science

whitespace_bleached.pl -
  Whitespace is an esoteric programming language, whose entire syntax is whitespace characters.
  In 2003, Michael Koelbl wrote a whitespace interpreter in Perl.
  In 2019, I got bored in a discussion with a friend, and ran that script through Damian Conway's wonderful library, Acme::Bleach.
  So now, there's a script with no visible syntax, which interprets and executes a language with no visible syntax!
